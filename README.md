# GoBlog
A Blog Application API built with Go, GORM, JWT, PostgreSQL/MySQL, and Gorilla Mux. It enables users to register, manage accounts, and securely create, edit, view, and delete blog posts. JWT ensures authentication and authorization, allowing users to manage only their own content while viewing others’ posts.
